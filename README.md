### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is Yutaro's Github. (Pronounced "You-tar-roe") 

- I currently work at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/), Department of Pediatric Oncology (+ Broad Institute, Cancer Program) with Drs. Riaz Gillani, Eli Van Allen, and Katie Janeway studying the genetic mechanisms of pediatric solid tumor cancers such as Osteosarcoma and Ewing's Sarcoma using omics data and computational biology methods.
- I graduated from Columbia Engineering in May 2023 majoring in Applied Mathematics (Quantitative Biology) and minoring in Biomedical Engineering and Philosophy.
  - During my time at Columbia, I conducted research in adverse drug events and pharmacogenomics in the [Tatonetti Lab](https://tatonettilab.org). 

- I'm interested in using [computational biology / biomedical informatics / data science] methods to study [pediatric cancers / rare diseases / population genetics / precision pharmacology].
- My recent public work will be available to access on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w7241CQAAAAJ&hl=en) or [orcid](https://orcid.org/0009-0004-1060-7065). More (hopefully) coming soon!
- I can be most easily reached at yutaro_tanaka [at] dfci.harvard.edu
