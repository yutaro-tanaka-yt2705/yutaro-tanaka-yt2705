### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is Yutaro's Github. (Pronounced "You-tar-roe") 

- I currently work at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/), Department of Pediatric Oncology (+ Broad Institute, Cancer Program) with Drs. Gillani, Van Allen, and Janeway studying the genetic mechanisms of pediatric solid tumor cancers such as Osteosarcoma and Ewing's Sarcoma using computational biology tools.
- I graduated from Columbia Engineering in May 2023 majoring in Applied Mathematics (Quantitative Biology) and minoring in Biomedical Engineering and Philosophy.
  - During my time at Columbia, I conducted research in adverse drug events and pharmaco-genomics in the [Tatonetti Lab](https://tatonettilab.org). 

- I'm interested in using [computational biology / biomedical informatics / data science] methods to study [pediatric cancer / rare disease / precision pharmacology].
- My recent published work will be available to access on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w7241CQAAAAJ&hl=en) page. 
- I can be most easily reached at yutaro_tanaka [at] dfci.harvard.edu
